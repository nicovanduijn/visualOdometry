\section{Introduction}
In the process of this course, we implemented several building blocks for a visual odometry pipeline during the exercise sessions. As a mini-project, our task was to put the pieces together and implement a full pipeline. In doing so, we are using some of the work from the exercises as well as some MATLAB functions from the Computer Vision Toolbox. Our final pipeline was tested on three different datasets and showed good performance up to a scale factor. A brief video showing the performance of our pipeline can be found \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DpAWUQQgVU}{\underline{here}}.


\section{Pipeline Structure}
\subsection{Initialization}
To initialize the pipeline, we use the normalized 8-point algorithm with RANSAC. We use only the monocular parts of the datasets in order to keep the pipeline as general as possible. Initially, a set of harris corners is detected, described and matched on the first and third image of the dataset. Then the 8-point algorithm in conjunction with RANSAC returns an estimation of the fundamental matrix, $\mat{F}$, of the camera. In order to quantify the accuracy of the current guess of $\mat{F}$ during the RANSAC algorithm, we use the point-to-epipolar-line-distance.\\
After RANSAC has determined the largest set of inliers, the 8-point algorithm is run again on the entire set of inliers. We then use the obtained fundamental matrix to triangulate a set of landmarks using all inlier matches from the harris corner detector. The set of landmarks and key points is now used to initialize the state.

\subsection{Lukas-Kanade Tracker}
Matching harris corners is computationally very costly, as the matching procedure increases quadratically with the number of features. Therefore we use Lucas-Kanade for key point tracking. We rely on the built-in Matlab function since it significantly boosts performance compared to the course implementation.

\subsection{Feature discard}
Features that could not be tracked with the Lucas-Kanade Tracker or were determined to be outliers by the P3P algorithm, are removed by incrementing their corresponding value in a voting array. Once a feature receives more than a certain threshold of votes, it is discarded. This ensures that temporary occlusions caused by moving objects in a scene do not cause complete loss of tracking and therefore improves robustness.

\subsection{P3P + RANSAC}
After the location of the features in the new frame has been found, we use the P3P algorithm in combination with RANSAC to calculate the current pose of the camera. Again, we increment the “discard” voting array for all key points that have been determined to be outliers by RANSAC.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
In order to have a good number of landmarks throughout the pipeline, we continuously extract new features. To do so, we extract the harris corners in the current frame, assert that they are a certain minimum distance away from the current key points and include them in our state as candidate key points. Along with the key points, we store the pose during their first respective observation.

\subsection{Linear Triangulation} 
In every iteration, we examine our candidate key points in order to determine whether they can be found in the current frame. If the angle between the bearing vectors of the current observation of the landmark and the first observation is large enough, we triangulate its position and add the feature to the key points in our state.

\subsection{Bonus Features}
\subsubsection{Structure-Only Bundle Adjustment}
In order to increase the accuracy of the pose estimation and to combat scale drift, we run structure-only bundle adjustment on all landmarks which have already been observed a certain number of times. While this will likely not be as effective as full bundle adjustment, it is computationally significantly cheaper.\\
Our approach is based on linear triangulation, but instead of only considering two point correspondences takes in account multiple ones. I.e., given $n$ point correspondences we have the following system of equations:
\begin{equation*}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} p_1^\times \mat{M}_1\\ \vdots \\ p_n^\times \mat{M}_n \end{bmatrix}}_{\mat{A}} \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} P_W \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mat{A} \vec{x} = 0
\end{equation*}
where $\mat{M}_i$ denotes the projection matrix of image $i$ and $p_i = [u,v,1]^T$ are homogeneous pixel coordinates. This linear-least squares problem is solved same as in the case for 2 point correspondences (i.e. using SVD). It is crucial for this approach to exclude any outliers. To this end, we only take into account observations where the reprojection error of the unadjusted landmark is sufficiently small. Furthermore a landmark is only adjusted if it could be tracked for at least 5 frames and we only consider the 10 most recent observations.

\subsubsection{Re-initialization}
We found that for large camera motion, the Lucas-Kanade Tracker would often fail to find the old key points in the new frame. This would mean that we have to either use brute-force matching on all key points, and remove many outliers, which would be very costly. Therefore we decided to re-initialize the entire pipeline with the 8-point algorithm if the number of successfully tracked key points drops below a certain threshold. This is slow and costly, but yields very good results, along with very accurate landmarks. Furthermore we found that this procedure alleviates scale drift to a large extent. We achieved good results with a minimum keypoint number of 30.\\
During our evaluation, we also tested a procedure where the pipeline re-initializes on a regular basis. This yields very good results, but obviously slows down the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Custom Dataset Testing}
As an additional bonus feature we made a video in the LFW building of the ETH with a mobile phone camera. To calibrate this camera we used the camera calibration function from the Computer Vision Toolbox in Matlab. The high frame rate of the camera we used lead to small movements between the frames. To overcome this issue and speed up the pipeline, we skip every other frame. We achieved reasonably accurate results as can be seen in the video. The dataset from this video can be found \href{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mhrpmllsdomer5p/AABb7Gz0JGaK-FXOYEMNzeGfa?dl=0}{\underline{here}}.

\section{Parameters and Tuning}
\subsection{RANSAC Iterations}
In the initialization procedure, RANSAC is run in conjunction with the 8-point algorithm. This means we need RANSAC to run long enough such that we have a reasonable chance of selecting 8 inliers in our dataset. By plotting the number of inliers over lots of iterations, we determined that 1000 iterations is a good number to use.

We still found that there occasionally are outlier-matches in this procedure. They are very rare and can best be explained by two falsely matched key points that happen to lie on the same epipolar line. With a large number of inliers this did not affect the performance significantly.

During the P3P pose estimation, we require only 3 points to obtain a pose estimate. Therefore the chances of selecting a sample entirely consisting of inliers is much larger and we found that 80 RANSAC iterations are usually sufficient. However, we received bad results for the parking dataset and chose to there increase the number of RANSAC iterations to 500 and received much better results.

\subsection{Harris Patch Size}
During the exercises, we used a harris patch radius of 9 pixels. This showed to be a good compromise for our implementation, as larger patches significantly slow down the pipeline without adding significant improvements in accuracy.

\subsection{Minimum Angle in Linear Triangulation}
When triangulating new landmarks, we ensure that the landmark position is accurate by checking for the angle spanned by the initial and the current observation. The angle depends on the relative motion of the camera as well as the distance to the landmark.
Very large angles proved to be strongly correlated with bad matches as well. We found that by setting a maximum angle, we were able to remove many outliers and achieve much better landmark triangulation. 
For the KITTI dataset we determined that a minimum angle of 1 degree and a maximum angle of 1.8 degrees yield good results. For the “parking” dataset we found that many landmarks are much closer to the camera, so we increased the maximum angle to 6 degrees.

\section{Results and Discussion}
In our pipeline evaluation, we tested the three datasets that were provided with the assignment, as well as our own custom dataset. We also tested with and without bundle adjustment in order to show its effectiveness. Furthermore, we enabled and disabled the continuous re-initialization to illustrate how it alleviates scale drift problems.

Our pipeline was primarily tested and tuned for the KITTI dataset. Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows our custom Z/X plot of the path estimated by our VO pipeline in red, as well as the ground truth provided as part of the dataset in blue. The top image shows the current frame with the successfully tracked key points highlighted with green lines, as well as the candidate key points in yellow. The red marks are newly added landmarks and the blue marks candidate keypoints which could successfully be triangulated. The bottom figure shows the current position with a red cross and the triangulated landmarks with green crosses.

\subsection{KITTI Dataset Comparison}
To compare the performance of our various implementations, we decided to use the KITTI dataset as a benchmark. In this section we will compare three different runs that showcase various trade-offs. First, we discuss our first working pipeline, without including bundle adjustment and periodic re-initialization. Then we compare it to more advanced versions, namely with added bundle adjustment and periodic re-initialization.

\subsubsection{No Bundle Adjustment, No Periodic Re-initialization}
Figure~\ref{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_no_reinit_thin} shows our first working implementation, without the added bundle adjustment or periodic re-initialization. It is apparent that the scale drifts significantly. In the middle of the plot, after the first right turn we notice a large deviation from the ground truth. Also the angles during the turns tend to be problematic, which accumulates errors as the pipeline progresses.

	\caption{Kitti -- no bundle adjustment, no periodic re-initialization}
	\label{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_no_reinit_thin}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{No Bundle Adjustment, Periodic Re-initialization}
It is clear that our pipeline can only be accurate up to a scale, since we are using monocular images only. The scale is estimated during initialization. This scale can drift as the pipeline advances. When comparing the scale from Figure~\ref{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_reinit_thin} to Figure~\ref{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_no_reinit_thin}, it is clear that the scale drifts much less, this is because we are periodically re-initializing to obtain new landmarks. The ratio between most segments of the estimated path to the ground truth remains constant throughout the path. The absolute rotation during turns is still not perfect and the longer the pipeline progresses, the larger this effect becomes.

	\caption{Kitti -- no bundle adjustment, periodic re-initialization}
	\label{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_reinit_thin}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bundle Adjustment, Periodic Re-initialization}
Figure~\ref{fig:Kitti_entire_BA_reinit_thin} shows our final implementation. When comparing to Figure~\ref{fig:Kitti_entire_no_BA_reinit_thin} we can see small improvements in accuracy due to the added bundle adjustment. The ratio of most segments compared to the ground truth looks very constant, and estimation of the orientation is slightly better. Since rotational errors accumulate to large position errors in long paths, accuracy in orientation estimation is crucial.

	\caption{Kitti -- bundle adjustment, periodic re-initialization}
	\label{fig:Kitti_entire_BA_reinit_thin}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Datasets}
We also ran our pipeline on various other datasets, including our own custom dataset recorded in the LFW building at ETH Zurich.

\subsubsection{ETH}
Figure~\ref{fig:ETH_BA_no_reinit} shows the plot of the estimated path during our own recorded dataset. Note that the corners should be right angles but our pipeline does not estimate this very well. This means our pipeline is not very robust to fast rotations, but estimates translations quite accurately.

	\input{images/ETH_BA_no_reinit.tikz}
	\caption{ETH -- bundle adjustment, no periodic re-initialization}
	\label{fig:ETH_BA_no_reinit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Malaga}
The malaga dataset is also a publicly available outdoor traffic environment dataset commonly used in the computer vision industry. The ground truth consists of a large oval-shaped path. Our results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:malaga_BA_reinit}, and resemble the ground truth very well with only minimal drift.

	\input{images/malaga_BA_reinit.tikz}
	\caption{Malaga -- bundle adjustment, periodic re-initialization}
	\label{fig:malaga_BA_reinit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Parking}
We also tested our pipeline on the provided "Parking" dataset. This dataset showed the worst performance of all datasets we tested, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:parking_BA_reinit}. The main reason for this is that we tuned our parameters to work best for camera motion in the $z$ direction of the camera frame, while the parking dataset consists of pure motion in $x$.

\section*{Some Comments on the Project}
We consider the project as a valuable experience, which helped a lot in understanding the matter and, by putting together all the building blocks, seeing the bigger picture. Besides that, having implemented a working pipeline oneself is pretty cool! However, in our opinion the time and effort required does not very well correlate with the 4 credit points granted. These should either be increased to 6 or you could consider skipping the oral exam and making the project account for the full grade. We would however not encourage to drop the project or reduce the number of exercises or their workload - although pretty time-consuming they are well done and definitely worth the effort!
